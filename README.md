## Introduction

Asteroids, commonly referred to as "space rocks" or "minor planets," are celestial objects that orbit the Sun, primarily in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. While most asteroids are small and benign, some have the potential to pose a significant threat to our planet. Understanding, tracking, and predicting the trajectories of these near-Earth objects (NEOs) is a crucial scientific endeavor. 

Our approach, blending preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and model selection, resulted in a successful Hazardous Asteroid prediction framework. AdaBoost, with high accuracy and recall scores, emerges as the optimal model. This comprehensive method not only advances asteroid prediction understanding but also holds practical implications for space exploration and planetary defense. The attained 94 percent accuracy underscores the methodology’s effectiveness, paving the way for robust celestial body detection.

- **P13_AST.ipynb**: This file is to train the models individually, contains preprocessing, feature selection, outlier detection and treatment, PCA analysis, SMOTE and then the model training and predictions.
- **PyCarert Model Evaluation.ipynb**: PyCaret is an open-source in Python that automates much of the workflow for multiple ML models. The code in this file helped in selecting and analyzing the models.
